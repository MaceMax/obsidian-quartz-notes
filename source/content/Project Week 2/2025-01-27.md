**Tasks completed today**:
- Setup a project diary.
- Set up the initial structure of my thesis report.
- Configured the development environment (mainly the shell) and installed some plugins.

**Adhering to time plan**: 
- [x] Yes
- [ ] No 

**Challenges or Delays**:
- Have still not been able to get access to my work computer. IT support was supposed to have sent a code to my boss, but he hasn't gotten it.

**Steps for Tomorrow**:
- Fix the damned work computer and hopefully get access to the code. Otherwise, read more about Vulkan and find other literature revolving the same area (for thesis report). It's hard to know what to delve deeper into regarding CUDA, when I don't have access to the code.
