**Tasks completed today**:
- Read up on Vulkan and made some notes about it.
- Tried to resolve the issue with work computer to no success. IT support is slow.
- Installed CUDA toolkit on the Jetson AGX Orin. 

**Adhering to time plan**: 
- [x] Yes
- [ ] No 

**Challenges or Delays**:
-  Have not got access to my work computer yet, meaning I can't access the repository that has the CUDA Code. 
- Have still not been assigned an internal supervisor from the university...

**Steps for Tomorrow**:
- Finish project plan (Make risk analysis, and risk management)
- Since I don't have access to the CUDA code, I can't start to analyse the algorithm. Instead, I will start writing the introduction of the thesis report. I've luckily allocated generous amount of time for the analysis of the algorithm, so no worries yet.
