	Was supposed to start reviewing the CUDA algorithm, but since I don't have access to code yet, I've been unable to. It's not really a problem yet, because according to my schedule I have the entire next week to analyse the algorithm :) I can start looking into the metrics also.

**Challenges or Delays**:
- No access to work computer yet.
- Having a hard time to start writing. 

**Steps for Tomorrow**:
- Continue with report, find relevant papers, and maybe start looking into the metrics a bit.
